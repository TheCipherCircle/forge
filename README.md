## What is F.O.R.G.E.?

F.O.R.G.E. gives agentic AI practitioners a shared vocabulary and proven practices for building with AI agents. Modeled after MITRE ATT&CK, it organizes methods into tactical pillars with implementation guidance, success indicators, and failure modes.

Every method exists because something went wrong and we built the system to prevent it from happening again.

## The Eight Pillars

| Pillar | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| **Foundation** | Why you collaborate with AI and what each party brings |
| **Governance** | Rules, authority, trust tiers, security |
| **Team Design** | Agent specialization, roles, parallel dispatch |
| **Invocation** | Context recovery, session handoffs, onboarding |
| **Execution** | Workflow patterns, iteration, error recovery |
| **Quality** | Testing, verification, output standards |
| **Knowledge** | Memory persistence, context management, institutional knowledge |
| **Evolution** | Progress tracking, contributor identity, framework growth |

## Technique Selector

Browse the matrix, select the methods that apply to your work, and export them as a clean Markdown document optimized for AI agent ingestion. Paste directly into a system prompt, CLAUDE.md, or agent configuration.

## Contributing

F.O.R.G.E. grows from real experience. If you've found a pattern that works or a method that's missing, we want to hear about it.
