The Testing Pyramid applies traditional software testing principles to human-AI collaboration: unit-level validation of individual outputs, integration testing of combined outputs, system testing of complete deliverables, and acceptance testing against human expectations. More tests at the base, fewer at the top, comprehensive coverage throughout.</td>

AI agents can write code quickly, but quality requires explicit standards: read existing code before modifying it, follow established patterns, don't introduce new dependencies without justification, and test before committing. Code Quality Standards convert implicit expectations into explicit, enforceable rules that agents follow consistently.</td>

The Review Period is not about distrust - it is about calibration. New contributors need time to learn project conventions, and the team needs time to assess the contributor's quality, reliability, and alignment with project standards. The review period formalizes this mutual calibration.</td>

AI agents typically work in one environment but their output may need to function across many. Cross-Platform Validation ensures that output is tested in every context it will encounter, not just the development environment.

When something goes wrong, the audit trail enables root cause analysis. When something goes right, it enables pattern replication. Every significant action should leave a mark in the record: who did it, what they did, why they did it, and when.</td>
